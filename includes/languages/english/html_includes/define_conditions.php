Cheapest Dinar / Guardian Svcs and this website do not make any recommendations or solicitations from or to its customers. Buying and holding foreign currency (<i>such as the Iraqi Dinar, Vietnamese Dong, and Chinese Yuan for examples</i>) poses a very direct risk of the purchaser being unable to convert the currency, or to exchange it back into US Dollars. There therefore exists the very real risk of a total financial loss, and therefore the collection of foreign currencies may not suitable for all collectors.
<br>
<br>

Cheapest Dinar / Guardian Svcs and this website advises all of our customers <u>NOT</u> to buy currency as an investment opportunity, investment resource, income stream, gamble or because of a speculated increase in value based on the predictions of any third parties.
<br>
<br>

It is unknown to anyone, and completely unpredictable to know when, or if a change in value of any currency is may, or may not occur. It is very possible, and likely that an increase of value in any currency will never happen, and therefore collecting of foreign currencies should be conducted strictly for collectible purposes, and not as a means of an investment opportunity.  Additionally, a change in value of any currency does NOT automatically denote an increase in value, as a foreign currency could easily lose value as well, resulting in large financial loss. 
<br>
<br>

Our customers should conduct their own research on any currency they are considering purchasing, before making said purchase. We strongly advise against our customers giving attention to, or taking credit in any rumors or hype concerning any foreign currency revaluation, or re-denomination that may be presented on the internet or elsewhere.
