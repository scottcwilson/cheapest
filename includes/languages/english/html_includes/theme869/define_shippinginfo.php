We understand that the shipping times for your purchases are important to you, and because they are important to you, they are equally important to us.&nbsp; Please keep in mind however that we have many members, and each of our members expects us to provide the same quality and expedited services that you yourself also expect from us.&nbsp; It is exactly this type of quality service that we intend to provide for each of you, however, personalized quality service can't be rushed.&nbsp; You may experience minor delays in shipping times immediately following an online sale, or immediately following an extended four (4) day Holiday weekend.

<br>



<span style="color:#000000;"><b><u>SHIPPING POLICIES&nbsp; & &nbsp;GUIDELINES</u>:</b></span>
<br><br>

All purchases are processed in the order in which they are received, and the payment is successfully processed.&nbsp; Payment processing times may be reviewed on our Payment Information page located at this link. ---> &nbsp; <a href="http://www.cheapestdinar.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=16"><span style="color:#0000FF;">CLICK HERE</span></a>
<br><br>

Before any order can ship, it must first have a successfully cleared payment for the purchase.&nbsp; Regardless of the size of your order, or any add-on shipping services you may select, your payment must clear processing before we will package your order.&nbsp; Payment processing times are different for each payment type, and can be found on the "Payment Information" page of the website. 
<br><br>


We will ship <b>ONLY</b> to the shipping address you choose at the time of your purchase.&nbsp; For security reasons, any request to change the shipping address after your purchase is submitted will be denied.&nbsp; You may store up to five (5) different shipping addresses in your account at one time without having to change your billing address.&nbsp; We do not offer international shipping for any of our products or services, therefore you MUST have a valid U.S. shipping address to purchase from our website.
<br><br>

We reserve the right to restrict deliveries using one of the various identification verification services offered by USPS, UPS and/or FedEx.&nbsp; Restricted deliveries will require a valid U.S. Government issue photo I.D. to sign for delivery acceptance.&nbsp;  Such orders will be shipped as "ID Restricted", meaning that only the person whose name is on the shipping information will be authorized to sign for receipt of delivery.&nbsp; We additionally reserve the right to require you to show proof of Identity prior to your payment being processed and/or shipped.&nbsp; These orders will be selected based on the age of the members account and/or the dollar value of the items purchased.
<br><br><br>

<span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>IMPORTANT SHIPPING NOTICE:</b></span><br>
If your package is damaged or opened upon arrival, then it is important that you refuse delivery with your postal carrier, and ask to sign a delivery refusal notification.&nbsp; We will not accept responsibility of the contents of any damaged package that is accepted by you.<br><br>

<b>IF A SIGNATURE DELIVERY IS REQUIRED:</b>&nbsp; Once your package is signed for, it will be considered to have been successfully delivered to the intended recipient and we will accept no further responsibility for the safe delivery of your package.&nbsp; ONLY in the event your package is delivered to the wrong address will we accept responsibility for incorrect delivery or missing packages.&nbsp; Therefore it is important that you personally, or another adult whom you authorize and trust explicitly be allowed to sign for and accept delivery of your package.<br><br>

Deliveries which require a signature will not be left without someone present whom can sign for delivery acceptance of your package.&nbsp; Please watch the provided tracking number (<i>if provided</i>) to avoid delivery time interruptions.&nbsp; If you miss delivery of your package, the Post Office will hold your package for 3-5 days before returning it back to us as undeliverable. <br><br>

Sometimes USPS may have longer than expected delivery times, please understand that we have no control over this and your patience is greatly appreciated during this time.&nbsp; If your package does not arrive within <b>10 BUSINESS DAYS</b>, please contact us and we provide instructions for you to open a claim with your local Post Office to locate your package.

<span style="color:#000000;"><b>SHIPPING / DELIVERY TIMES&nbsp; & &nbsp;GUIDELINES</b></span>
<br><br>


You should be aware that USPS <b>"Delivery Confirmation"</b>&nbsp; is NOT the same as USPS <b>Tracking Information</b>.&nbsp;  As stated on the USPS website as of 2016, USPS will no longer promises the service package location tracking during transit.&nbsp;  While package location tracking may sometimes be provided with the Delivery Confirmation service, the only <b>guarantee</b> made by USPS is that delivery information will show as "Confirmation Of Delivery" once the package has been successfully delivered to it's destination location. 
<br><br>

<b>Most</b> orders UNDER $300 will <b>NOT</b> include Delivery/Tracking Information.&nbsp; If you require package tracking during transit, you MUST choose the appropriate upgraded shipping option which provides the specific service you require.&nbsp; Our upgraded shipping services are offered under the "Shipping Services" tab on the left side of the website. 
<br><br>



If you require or wish to have delivery/tracking information for your purchase and your purchase is under $300 USD, then you must select that shipping upgrade service when creating your online order.&nbsp; If you choose an upgraded shipping service, then your Delivery Confirmation Number will be emailed to you once your order has shipped.
<br><br>

Currency orders over $500 will be REQUIRED to be shipped using the Adult Signature Restricted delivery service.&nbsp; If there is not an adult present at the time of delivery, the Post Office will hold your package at your local post office for between 7 to 14 calendar days before returning it to our office.&nbsp; The exact amount of time your Post office will hold your package will vary by location, and it is your sole responsibility to familiarize yourself with those policies.

Currency orders over $750 will be shipped restricted delivery via USPS Priority Mail, and will require a Photo-ID to accept delivery of your shipment.&nbsp; Most currency orders over $1,000 will be shipped restricted delivery via USPS Priority Express - Overnight Mail.&nbsp; Priority Express Overnight Delivery will arrive within TWO BUSINESS DAYS after your order is processed, and your package has been shipped.
<br><br>

<b>OVERNIGHT DELIVERY:</b>&nbsp; Overnight Delivery Services does NOT imply that your order will be shipped the day of your purchase, nor that you will receive your shipment the day after your purchase.&nbsp; <u>ALL</u> purchases, including those upgraded to overnight delivery, are subject to the posted order processing and payment clearing times.&nbsp; Upgrading to Priority Express guarantees <u>ONLY</u> that once your order is ready to ship, it will be shipped using the Priority Express Overnight delivery service.
<br><br>

<b>RUSH PROCESSING:</b>&nbsp; Rush Processing does NOT imply that your order will be shipped the day of your purchase.&nbsp; Rush Processing only promises that your payment and your order will be processed and packaged for shipping ahead of all pre-existing orders placed by other members.&nbsp; However, your order will still be processed in the order in which is it received in-line with other members orders which were also upgraded to rush processing.&nbsp; To Ensure that your order is processed and ships on the SAME day, you must choose both Rush processing AND one of the expedited shipping upgrades offered below.&nbsp;  The fee for Rush Processing is $10 USD per order.
