<br><br><br>

<b>Our Updated Policies...</b><br><br>

<font size="2">
We understand that the shipping times for your purchases are important to you, and because they are important to you, they are equally important to us also.&nbsp; Please keep in mind however that we have many members, and each of our members expects us to provide the same quality and expedited services that you yourself also expect from us.&nbsp; It is exactly this type of quality service that we intend to provide for each of our customers.&nbsp; However, service that is personalized can't be rushed if it is expected to retain this type of quality.&nbsp; We promise to give each purchase the undivided attention that's required to assure order accuracy, and safe delivery to your door.&nbsp; Because we will never sacrifice quality for speed, your patience is greatly appreciated when  awaiting delivery of your purchases.

We ship orders twice each week with dispatch days being on Tuesday and Friday.&nbsp; Order submitted between Monday and Thursday will ship on Fridays.&nbsp; Orders submitted between Friday through Sunday will ship on Tuesdays.&nbsp; However, when there is an increase in orders being submitted,such as during a sale, then there is a chance your order may be placed into over-flow processing, causing the dispatch day to move to the next scheduled shipping day.&nbsp; ONLY when an order is submitted with RUSH PROCESSING will your order ship on any other day than dispatch days.&nbsp; If an order is submitted on Tuesday and upgraded to RUSH PROCESSING, the order will ship the next available dispatch day.&nbsp; Orders placed AFTER 2:30pm EST with Rush Processing will ship within two BUSINESS DAYS.&nbsp; Orders submitted on Tuesday with Rush Processing, will ship on Thursday instead of Friday.
<br><br>


Delays in shipping times can be expected during any of the following scenarios; Immediately following an online sale, immediately following four (4) day weekend, Immediately following a Holiday weekend, Immediately following any Postal/Gov shutdown and/or Postal closure.&nbsp; Delays in shipping can also be expected anytime there is an increase in online purchases and/or order fulfillment such as during or after a sale, or when there may be an excess flow of customers fulfilling their orders all at the same time.&nbsp; It is during these times that your patience and understanding is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; In a worse case scenario, dispatch times can range <i>UP TO</i> 10-14 BUSINESS days.
<br><br>

<b>IMPORTANT SHIPPING TIME NOTICE</b><br>
When there is a delay in shipping, it is VERY helpful to us if our customers are able to keep phone calls and email inquiries regarding shipping statuses to a minimum.&nbsp; We do not know an exact day and/or time each customers order will ship until the actual day of shipping.&nbsp; Therefore we are unable to provide dispatch or shipping updates by phone.&nbsp; We can only say that orders are processed and dispatched in the order in which the payment is submitted and approved.&nbsp; Continuous phone inquiries regarding shipping will therefore only delay the shipping time for ALL customers affected.&nbsp; We will always send you an email update with regarding the current status of your order, this will include updates regarding shipping notifications once your order has shipped.
<br><br>

All orders are processed and dispatched in the order in which the payment is received and approved.&nbsp; Payments are processed in the order in which they are received, and orders are subsequently processed in the order in which payments are approved.&nbsp; This is of great significance when order are paid by check and/or money order as your order is NOT processed the day yoru payment is received.&nbsp; We first must deposit your payment BEFORE your order shall be processed.&nbsp; A complete explanation of payment processing times can be found on the Payment Information page,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cheapestdinar.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=16"><span style="color:#0000FF;">CLICK HERE</span></a></font>
