Cheapest Dinar is the name of our website, and a very catchy name it is. However, we humbly admit that our name by no means promises, or offers any kind of guarantee that we offer the cheapest dinar currency. In fact, some of our prices are indeed a little higher than our competitors, and we realize this. Sometimes, its the value in service and individual attention we offer that matters more than price, and we like to believe that our value is within our service.
<br>
<br>

Some of our favorite collectible currencies include the Iraqi Dinar, Vietnamese Dong, Zimbabwe Dollars, Indian Rupee, Afghanistan Afghani Chinese Yuan, Arabian Dirham, and various early style US currencies, US currency Certificates and promissory notes.
<br>
<br>

We will consider the purchase of various collectible items from our members, and other vendors that may have items for sale of a nature similar to our specific interests. Such items we, or our members may be interested in include fine jewels, precious metals, collectible artistic bonds and/or certificates, artistic currency note related items and other items of similar interest.

<strong>LEGAL DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
We do not claim, indicate or suggest there will ever be a currency Rv (Revalue / revaluation), or a re-denomination of any currency that we offer or sell. While the currencies we offer/sell are real/authentic currencies, they are indeed collectible currencies are are sold strictly as such. Some of the currencies we offer or sell or no longer in use within their country of origin, and have absolutely no monetary value, other than their specific collectible value. An example of such currency is the Zimbabwe Dollar, which is not believed by us to be in use within the country of Zimbabwe at this time. Additionally, we do not not claim, indicate or suggest that the Zimbabwe Dollar currency will ever be re-instituted, or reactivated as a valid currency within Zimbabwe at anytime.
<br>
<br>

By purchasing our currencies, products, or lay-away services, you hereby agree to not use our currencies or services for investment purposes or opportunities of any kind.

<strong>MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE AND ARE WAITING FOR A IRAQI DINAR REVALUATION.</strong> BE IT KNOWN TO THESE PERSONS that we do not claim, indicate, promise, elude to, nor suggest there will ever be an Iraqi Dinar Rv (revaluation), a Dinar re-denomination, or any other kind of revalue, or increase in value of the Iraqi Dinar currency! WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THE SAME concerning any and all other currencies that we may offer, or sell.

<br>
<br>

<strong>BE IT KNOWN</strong> that by means of buying, purchasing, accepting as a gift or sample, and therefore holding, possessing or owning foreign currency (<em>such as the Iraqi Dinar, Vietnamese Dong, and Chinese Yuan</em>) there exists a very direct risk of the holder/owner being unable to convert the currency, or to exchange it back into US Dollars. Therefore, there exists the very real risk of a total financial loss as the bearer may not be able to convert their currency collection back into US dollars, or they may not be able to find a purchaser of their currency collection. it is for this reason, that collecting foreign currencies for any reason may not suitable for all collectors.
<br>
<br>

Cheapest Dinar, PayDay Currencies and this website advises all of our members NOT to buy currency as an investment opportunity, investment resource, income stream, gamble or because of a speculated increase in value. Collecting world currencies is a very intriguing and fascinating hobby and passion, and one can find themselves consumed in it without realizing it. For his reason, we urge all people to collect currencies and other like items responsibly.
<br>
<br>

It is unknown to anyone, and completely unpredictable to know when, or if a change in value in any currency is going to occur. It is very possible, and likely that an increase of value in any currency will <strong>NEVER</strong> happen, and therefore purchasing foreign currencies should always be conducted strictly for collectible purposes. Additionally, a change in value in any currency does not automatically suggest an increase in value, as any currency could easily lose value as well. Our members should conduct their own research on any currency they are considering purchasing, before making any purchase. We strongly advise against our customers giving attention to, or taking credit in any rumors or hype concerning any currency value that may be presented on the internet or elsewhere as these types of rumors are almost always incorrect.
<br>
<br>

We do not promise, suggest, indicate or convey in any manner, nor do we ourselves claim to believe that there will ever be a revaluing or re-denominating of any currency we offer or sell. By purchasing our currency, services or products, you agree that you understand that these are NOT investment items or investment opportunities. Additionally, you agree that by purchasing any item or service we sell, that you promise to use said product or service strictly as a collectible item and for collectible purposes, and that your intended use of our products is not for investment reasons.
