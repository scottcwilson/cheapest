It is unknown to anyone, and completely unpredictable to know when, or if a change in value in any currency is going to occur. It is very possible, and likely that an increase of value in any currency will <strong>NEVER</strong> happen, and therefore purchasing foreign currencies should always be conducted strictly for collectible purposes. Additionally, a change in value in any currency does not automatically suggest an increase in value, as any currency could easily lose value as well. Our members should conduct their own research on any currency they are considering purchasing, before making any purchase. We strongly advise against our customers giving attention to, or taking credit in any rumors or hype concerning any currency value that may be presented on the internet or elsewhere as these types of rumors are almost always incorrect.<br />
